# MystroApp

Coding challenge for Mystro Driver with authentication and user preference saving and editing.

### Install Project Dependencies
```
npm install
```

## App Configuration

You will need to add your own auth0 configuration (including domain, client ID and API token) in order to use auth0 for authentication and user data storage.

## Future Improvements

1. User default login: no need to press Login/Signup if already authenticated
1. Fix Navigation to clear stack
